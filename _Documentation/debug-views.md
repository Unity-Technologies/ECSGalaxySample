# Debug Views

In the `Main` scene, under the `GameSceneObjects` GameObject, there is a `SimulationDebug` GameObject that can help you understand the inner workings of the game by offering several debug views. You can activate these debug views during Play mode by toggling the various "Modes" checkboxes in the `SimulationDebug` component.
